books
-----
| 4/21/2005
| walking through the shelves of a library

| deny me the pleasure of wisdom.


where we want to be

| what can we do today to help us tomorrow?
| Teams, agreements, goals, plans, schedules.


exert for freedom
-----------------
| 7/17/2008
| If you are slow, they will drag you. If you can find the energy to run ahead, then you can make your path. If only we remember what we wanted to do when trapped instead of being distracted when free. Have the strength to stay focused and save yourself.

| why we are here
| what we came to do.


before hunger

| Before hunger makes me forget my directions, while I can still see dimly with one eye, let me write a list of what I need to do, and program myself to stick to this list to ensure that I will execute it even when I lose the ability to reprogram myself because my prefrontal cortex has shut down to save energy.


how to contribute
-----------------
| 6/9/2010

| Run checklist.
| Eat. Did you eat more than four hours ago?
| Sleep. Rest your broken body.
| Exercise.
| Write in journal. Don't show anyone.
| Talk meaningfully with confidante, even a stranger.
| Say, "I can do it."

--------------------------

| A person becomes a better driver through experience.
| Experienced drivers easily gain the trust of their passengers.


active optimism
---------------
| 1/23/2012
| If love is about negotiating a way to fulfill both people's needs, then maybe friendship is about sharing experiences and showing interest in the lives of others.  It is natural to lose connection with people, no matter how close was the bond.  Replenishing and cultivating your garden of friends are lifelong activities.  Remind yourself that it is worth the effort and that it is never too late as long as you are alive.  Think good thoughts about others.  Work with what you have, even if it is imperfect.  Moving forward does not mean you have to start over.

| A relationship is an agreement between two parties on what you will do for me in exchange for what I do for you, with boundaries on which activities and information can be shared with other parties and which activities and information must be exclusive for the agreement to hold.  Givers try to negotiate by offering more costs.  Takers try to negotiate by demanding more benefits.

reach life goals
----------------
| 2/2/2014
| When overwhelmed with work, I might schedule too much for one day in the wishful hope that I will magically get it all done.  This is a false and unfair promise.  It is not how much I get done, but whether I am doing what is essential toward a long-term goal.
| If I reach only one goal today, which one will take me closest to where I want to be?
