books
-----
| 4/21/2005
| walking through the shelves of a library

| and lack of intelligence
| deny me the pleasure of wisdom.


where we want to be
-------------------
| 9/16/2006
| If this is not the life we wanted,
| what can we do today to help us tomorrow?
| Teams, agreements, goals, plans, schedules.


exert for freedom
-----------------
| 7/17/2008
| If you are slow, they will drag you. If you can find the energy to run ahead, then you can make your path. If only we remember what we wanted to do when trapped instead of being distracted when free. Have the strength to stay focused and save yourself.

| Let us renew
| why we are here
| what we came to do.


before hunger 
-------------
| 12/16/2009
| Before hunger makes me forget my directions, while I can still see dimly with one eye, let me write a list of what I need to do, and program myself to stick to this list to ensure that I will execute it even when I lose the ability to reprogram myself because my prefrontal cortex has shut down to save energy.


how to contribute
-----------------
| 6/9/2010
| Emergency disconnect. My world is upside down today!
| Think, "I have experienced this before."
| Run checklist.
| Eat. Did you eat more than four hours ago?
| Sleep. Rest your broken body.
| Exercise.
| Write in journal. Don't show anyone.
| Talk meaningfully with confidante, even a stranger.
| Say, "I can do it."

a woman needs to feel safe

| She might overtake the steering wheel in an emergency, but does not like to do this all the time.
| It is not enough for the driver to behave as though he knows what he is doing, for the passenger can sense whether they are headed in the right direction.
| A person becomes a better driver through experience.
| Experienced drivers easily gain the trust of their passengers.


active optimism
---------------
| 1/23/2012
| If love is about negotiating a way to fulfill both people's needs, then maybe friendship is about sharing experiences and showing interest in the lives of others.  It is natural to lose connection with people, no matter how close was the bond.  Replenishing and cultivating your garden of friends are lifelong activities.  Remind yourself that it is worth the effort and that it is never too late as long as you are alive.  Think good thoughts about others.  Work with what you have, even if it is imperfect.  Moving forward does not mean you have to start over.

| A relationship is an agreement between two parties on what you will do for me in exchange for what I do for you, with boundaries on which activities and information can be shared with other parties and which activities and information must be exclusive for the agreement to hold.  Givers try to negotiate by offering more costs.  Takers try to negotiate by demanding more benefits.

reach life goals
----------------
| 2/2/2014
| When overwhelmed with work, I might schedule too much for one day in the wishful hope that I will magically get it all done.  This is a false and unfair promise.  It is not how much I get done, but whether I am doing what is essential toward a long-term goal.
| If I reach only one goal today, which one will take me closest to where I want to be?
| Ask people to do specific tasks.
| Describe a ten-minute mission and cross it out when done.

| The secret to staying focused is to take breaks.


passion vs dedication
---------------------
| 8/30/2014
| Would you stay in a job that makes you unhappy? I was in a serious relationship for over seven years and stayed with several employers for much longer than necessary. I thought dedication was more important. I have since left these toxic relationships and am leading a much happier life. From experience, I can emphatically say that passion is key to success in any endeavor.


female attraction

plan to get what you want

-----------------
| 5/3/2015
| If I decide that a request is not in my best interest, then I need to say no firmly and stick to it, regardless of what the other person says or does or how many times the person asks.
| If the other person proceeds to do what is not in my best interest, then I need to respond and act strongly to respect and defend what is important to me.
| It is foolish to give in, sacrifice what I want and then seethe afterwards.  If I change my mind and say yes, then I need to take full responsibility for the consequences.
| Other people have the right to ask me anything, no matter how ridiculous or harmful to myself, but it is my responsibility to protect myself and what is important to me.


unequal pricing
---------------
| 5/9/2015
| When a taxi attendant asks you questions about 
| where you are from,
| where you are going,
| when is your flight,
| he is trying to decide how much to charge you.


time cushion
------------
| 5/9/2015
| A generous time cushion is important when events are unpredictable and uncontrollable.
| With more time, there are more options; you can negotiate and relax.
| Being relaxed is good for your health.

| The less I can concentrate, the smaller my tasks must be.


while I can
-----------
| 8/7/2015
| Time passes. You might be here, but so far away. And I feel guilty for not having kept my promises, even to myself. When will I reach my goals? Why do I often lose focus? Please forgive me, but I will do better today bit by bit while I can.


punctual progress
-----------------
| 9/20/2015
| As long as I'm closer and closer to being on time with my promises, there is progress.


deadlines

| Maybe deadlines are the key to progress.


order of operations
-------------------
| 10/16/2015
| Don't give me that nonsense about being too busy for your own health.

to my sister
------------
| 11/11/2015
| You can call me whenever you need help or support, even if you're with someone I don't like or do something I don't like. But I'm not going to try to control your life (like Daddy did with Mommy), because I respect your right to make your own decisions.
