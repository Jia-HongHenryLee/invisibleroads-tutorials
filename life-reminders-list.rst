books
-----
| 4/21/2005

| deny me the pleasure of wisdom.


where we want to be

| If this is not the life we wanted,
| what can we do today to help us tomorrow?
| Teams, agreements, goals, plans, schedules.


exert for freedom
-----------------
| 7/17/2008
| If you are slow, they will drag you. If you can find the energy to run ahead, then you can make your path. If only we remember what we wanted to do when trapped instead of being distracted when free. Have the strength to stay focused and save yourself.

| Let us renew
| why we are here
| what we came to do.


before hunger 
-------------
| 12/16/2009
| Before hunger makes me forget my directions, while I can still see dimly with one eye, let me write a list of what I need to do, and program myself to stick to this list to ensure that I will execute it even when I lose the ability to reprogram myself because my prefrontal cortex has shut down to save energy.


how to contribute
-----------------
| 6/9/2010
| Emergency disconnect. My world is upside down today!
| Think, "I have experienced this before."
| Run checklist.
| Eat. Did you eat more than four hours ago?
| Sleep. Rest your broken body.
| Exercise.
| Write in journal. Don't show anyone.
| Talk meaningfully with confidante, even a stranger.
| Say, "I can do it."
| Say, "I can do it!"

| What can we do today to help us tomorrow?
| Teamwork starts with taking care of yourself.

| live forward


no no no
--------

internal compass
----------------
| 11/17/2011

take action
-----------

a woman needs to feel safe
--------------------------
| 12/19/2011
| A passenger can sit comfortably if she trusts the ability of the driver.
| She might overtake the steering wheel in an emergency, but does not like to do this all the time.
| It is not enough for the driver to behave as though he knows what he is doing, for the passenger can sense whether they are headed in the right direction.
| A person becomes a better driver through experience.
| Experienced drivers easily gain the trust of their passengers.


active optimism
---------------
| 1/23/2012
| If love is about negotiating a way to fulfill both people's needs, then maybe friendship is about sharing experiences and showing interest in the lives of others.  It is natural to lose connection with people, no matter how close was the bond.  Replenishing and cultivating your garden of friends are lifelong activities.  Remind yourself that it is worth the effort and that it is never too late as long as you are alive.  Think good thoughts about others.  Work with what you have, even if it is imperfect.  Moving forward does not mean you have to start over.  


make your own options

| If you ask a taxi driver at the airport how to get to the city, he will tell you there are no buses.

| 3/19/2012
| Each day, I would like to learn and share what I have learned, in a way that other people can use.

| Only you will care as much about your children to teach them the skills you believe are necessary to thrive.


guard your time
---------------
| 6/27/2012

dominance
---------

| How does a person, group or country submit to the will of another?
| Do the friendly lose?
| Do the aggressive win?
