Reach life goals
================
Mixing strategy with spontaneity puts you on a path to reaching your life goals with enough flexibility to adapt to changes.

Plan
----
#. Envision what you want your life to be like five years from now.
#. Rank long-term goals.
#. Set concrete milestones with deadlines.
#. Schedule reasonable steps for reaching milestones.
#. Be honest with yourself and stick to your schedule.

Do
--
When overwhelmed with work, I might schedule too much in one day in the wishful hope that I will magically get it all done.  This is a false and unfair promise.  It is not how much you get done, but whether you are doing what is essential toward a long-term goal.

Choose
^^^^^^
If I can reach only one goal today, which one will take me closest to where I want to be?  

Rank
^^^^
Suppose I accomplish A but not B, how would I feel?  Rank goals in advance to make decisions quickly.

Mark
^^^^
Mark selected tasks as crucial to my mission.  Finish crucial tasks first.

Talk
^^^^
Talk and work next to people with similar interests to boost morale.

Walk
^^^^
Write one task and do it.  By choosing my action one at a time, I can decide what to do next using the most current information.

Sprint
^^^^^^
Start a timer with an alarm for ten minutes, then work against the clock.  It really works!

Finish
^^^^^^
Estimate how long a task will take, then record how long it actually took.  Your ability to estimate completion time will improve dramatically.
