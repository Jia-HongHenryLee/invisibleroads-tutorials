Coordinate teams
================
- Healthy teams talk a lot while unhealthy teams do not.  Talking is healthy because what might be difficult for one person could be easy for another person.  Healthy teams have a positive attitude.  [#LukeStone]_

- A bus is a concept for allocating a team's time on a project.  A person can only be on one bus.  Three to four people make a team.  At most one person on a team switches projects at any time to ensure continuity.  Pairing a senior with a junior is a good combination because the senior can foresee what can go wrong while the junior brings fresh perspective.  [#LukeStone]_

- Standardizing components across multiple tools can simplify maintenance.  Removing technical debt frees time that would be otherwise spent in maintenance.  Mockups save time.  [#LukeStone]_

- In a meeting, each participant answers, "What have I done today?  What will I do tomorrow?  What do I need help with?"  These are also good questions to ask yourself on a regular basis.  [#LukeStone]_
