=====
Make sure your partner is having fun.

- Directions are from a bird's eye point of view, so that if a woman turns to her right, she is turning clockwise.
- In the basic step, the man uses his left leg to step forward and his right leg to step backward.
- The man's frame supports the woman's frame.
- If the woman and man turn or spin at the same time, the man signals the woman to spin or turn first, then the man spins or turns but must finish before she does so that he can signal the next lead.
- Listen for the downbeat.
- Shift weight onto the moving foot.
- Shift weight even when not moving, to stay in beat.
- Keep your eyes focused on your partner.
- Adjust your dance according to the level of your partner.
- Beware of making your partner dizzy with too many consecutive turns and spins.
