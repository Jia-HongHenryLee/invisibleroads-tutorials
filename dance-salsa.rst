- Make sure your partner is having fun.
- Keep your eyes focused on your partner.
- Adjust your dance to the level of your partner.
- Straighten the right leg as you use it to push forwards on the second beat.
- Straighten the left leg as you use it to push backwards on the sixth beat.
- Take steps even when not moving, to stay in beat.
- Beware of making your partner dizzy with too many turns and spins.
- If the woman and man turn at the same time, the man signals the woman to turn first, then the man turns but must finish before she does so that he can signal the next lead.
- Directions are from a bird's eye point of view, so that if a woman turns to her right, she is turning clockwise.
